(ns aac.decode
  "AAC-LC decode: ADTS frame -> PCM samples (ISO/IEC 14496-3:2005 §4.4-4.6).
   This is the top-level entry point tying together `aac.adts` (framing,
   pre-existing), `aac.ics` (side info + noiseless-coding spectral decode,
   incl. `channel_pair_element()`/CPE stereo parsing), `aac.dequant`
   (inverse quantization), `aac.stereo` (mid/side reconstruction), and
   `aac.imdct` (filterbank: IMDCT + windowing + overlap-add).

   ## Scope (deliberately narrow — this is the ecosystem's first audio
   codec implementation; see `com-junkawasaki/root` task history)

   - **Mono (`single_channel_element()`/SCE, channel_configuration 1) OR
     stereo (`channel_pair_element()`/CPE, channel_configuration 2,
     including mid/side stereo — see `aac.ics`/`aac.stereo`)**. Intensity
     stereo (a per-band pseudo-codebook, not a CPE-level tool), LFE,
     coupling channels, and multi-element/program_config_element streams
     all still throw.
   - **All four `window_sequence` values** — ONLY_LONG_SEQUENCE,
     LONG_START_SEQUENCE, EIGHT_SHORT_SEQUENCE and LONG_STOP_SEQUENCE, i.e.
     block switching. This is what makes real encoder output decodable at
     all: encoders switch to EIGHT_SHORT at every transient, so a stream
     with any attack in it — which is every stream that is not a steady
     tone — used to be undecodable from its very first frame. The
     `test/aac/decode_test.clj` fixtures now decode from frame 0 through the
     end of the file, transients included, rather than from a hand-picked
     steady-state frame range.
   - **No SBR/PS** (this is plain AAC-LC, not HE-AAC/HE-AACv2), **no LTP**,
     **no predictor, pulse, TNS, or gain-control tools**, **no PNS or
     intensity stereo** (`aac.ics` throws on all of these — see that
     namespace's docstring, particularly for PNS: it's near-ubiquitous in
     real encoder output, so real fixtures here were generated with
     `ffmpeg -aac_pns 0`).
   - Only 11-bit `sampling_frequency_index` values 3 (48000 Hz) and 4
     (44100 Hz) are supported (`aac.tables`) — this repo's fixtures are all
     44100 Hz.

   ## Multi-element raw_data_block handling

   A real encoder's `raw_data_block()` is not always a bare single
   `single_channel_element()`/`channel_pair_element()` — `ffmpeg -c:a aac`
   was observed (during development) to prepend a `fill_element()`
   (`id_syn_ele` 6, ancillary/padding data, Table 4.11) before the SCE/CPE
   even in a stream's very first frame. `decode-raw-data-block!` (mono) and
   `decode-raw-data-block-cpe!` (stereo) below both skip `fill_element()`/
   `data_stream_element()` (Tables 4.10/4.11) structurally to reach the
   SCE/CPE, and throw immediately on any OTHER syntax element since those
   are out of this repo's scope."

   This happens AFTER dequantization and AFTER mid/side reconstruction, not
   before: scalefactors and `ms_used` are both indexed by (window group,

   IMPORTANT caveat if `frames` is a MID-STREAM slice (not starting at the
   true stream start): the first frame's OWN output will not match a real
   decoder's (which would have real, non-zero history from the actual
   preceding frame) — only the SECOND frame onward is bit-comparable,
   because each frame's own second-half overlap state (saved for the next
   frame) is computed independent of the input history, only the additive
   output for that one frame is affected. `test/aac/decode_test.clj`
