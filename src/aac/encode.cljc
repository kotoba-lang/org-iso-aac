(ns aac.encode
  "AAC-LC encode: PCM samples -> ADTS AAC bitstream (ISO/IEC 14496-3:2005
   §4.4-4.6, read in the write direction). The mirror of `aac.decode`, tying
   together `aac.mdct` (forward filterbank), `aac.quant` (forward
   quantization + per-band scalefactors), `aac.huffman`'s encode side
   (noiseless coding), and `aac.adts`' `write-header`/`audio-specific-config`
   (framing).

   ## What this is for

   `com-junkawasaki/root` ADR-2800002800 recorded that the pure-cljc codec
   path could not produce an MP4 audio track at all: `org-iso-aac` decoded but
   did not encode, so `ffmpeg` could not be dropped from the pipeline no
   matter how fast the video path got. This namespace closes that gap. The
   proof that it is closed is not that it runs — it is that REAL ffmpeg
   decodes its output and gets the signal back (`test/aac/encode_test.clj`,
   which runs the repo's golden-vector methodology in reverse).

   ## Scope, stated as limitations rather than as features

   - **`ONLY_LONG_SEQUENCE` only — NO block switching.** Real encoders switch
     to `EIGHT_SHORT_SEQUENCE` on transients precisely because a 2048-sample
     window smears a sharp attack backwards in time (pre-echo). This encoder
     cannot, so percussive material will sound worse than ffmpeg's at the same
     bitrate in a way that is audible, not merely measurable. Steady material
     (speech, sustained tones, synthesised narration/BGM — what
     ADR-2800002800's consumer actually feeds it) is where it is fine.
     Note this is now an ENCODER-only limit: the decoder reads all four
     window sequences (`aac.imdct`/`aac.ics`), so the short/transition
     windows and window grouping already exist. Closing it here needs a
     transient detector and a switching decision — i.e. the psychoacoustic
     model listed next — not more filterbank.
   - **No psychoacoustic model.** Bits are allocated by the power law's own
     mild shaping (`aac.quant`'s alpha = 1/4 default) and a rate loop, not by
     masking thresholds. At equal bitrate ffmpeg will usually sound better
     while scoring WORSE on plain SNR, because it deliberately puts noise
     where it is masked. Do not read this encoder's higher SNR as higher
     quality.
   - **No TNS, no PNS, no intensity stereo, no LTP, no pulse coding, no
     SBR/PS.** Mid/side stereo IS implemented (`ms_used` per band).
   - **Mono (SCE) and stereo (CPE)** at 44100 or 48000 Hz — the sample rates
     `aac.tables` has scalefactor-band tables for.
   - **O(N^2) forward MDCT.** See `aac.mdct`; adequate here, and measured in
     `test/aac/encode_test.clj` rather than assumed.

   Everything in that list is a thing this encoder does not do, not a thing
   the format cannot do; each is a separate follow-on, and none of them is
   needed for the bitstream to be conformant.

   ## Bit accounting is exact, and asserted to be

   `frame-bits` predicts a frame's size to the bit, and `encode-frame-sce`/
   `-cpe` assert the writer wrote exactly that many. This is not decoration:
   the rate-control loop chooses the quantizer by that prediction, so a
   prediction that drifted from reality would silently produce frames of the
   wrong size — the kind of bug that shows up as a bitrate that is 8% off and
   nothing else. Making the two check each other means the section/scalefactor/
   spectral cost model has to stay honest.

   ## Scalefactors of all-zero bands are free, and that is load-bearing

   The section-boundary optimiser may put an all-zero band inside a section
   coded with a real codebook (merging two runs is often cheaper than the
   9-14 bits a section header costs). Such a band must then carry a
   scalefactor. It is written as differential 0 — 1 bit, and legal by
   construction — because every scalefactor reconstructs an all-zero band
   identically (`aac.dequant` maps quantized 0 to 0.0 at any scalefactor). The
   band's nominal scalefactor is discarded. That is what keeps the DPCM chain
   over the genuinely-coded bands exactly as `aac.quant/clamp-dpcm-chain` left
   it, so no delta can escape the codebook's +/-60 range."

   frame's bit allowance down, is what makes `<= bitrate` a guarantee rather
   than an approximation: without the alignment allowance a frame that exactly
   filled its budget would still grow by a byte on the way out."

  "Smallest (finest) quantizer position whose cost fits `budget`. Bits fall
   monotonically as the scalefactor rises — every band's effective scalefactor
   is `max(base_sf, its own floor)`, which is itself monotone, so coarser can
   never cost more — and the bisection needs nothing else. Returning the
   smallest fitting value spends the whole budget rather than leaving quality on
   the table.

   `cost-fn` is the EXACT cost (a full `plan-channel`, section optimiser
   included), not an upper bound. An earlier version bisected on a cheap
   per-band upper bound instead; it undershot the target by 12% (measured:
   112 kbps for a 128 kbps request) because the bound ignored exactly the
   section merging the optimiser then performed. The exact form costs one extra
   dynamic-programming pass per probe over work already being done, which is
   not where the time goes (the forward MDCT is).

   If even 255 does not fit, 255 is returned and the frame overruns the target —
   an honest overrun (ADTS frames may be up to 8191 bytes) instead of a
   silently mangled one."

(defn ms-decision
  "Per-band `ms_used`: code mid/side rather than L/R where doing so is
   predicted to cost fewer bits.

   The criterion is derived rather than tuned. Under the usual
   rate-vs-distortion result that a band of `n` lines with variance `v` needs
   about `(n/2) log2(v / noise)` bits, coding two channels costs
   `(n/2) log2(v1 v2 / noise^2)` — so, at a fixed noise floor, whichever pair
   has the smaller PRODUCT of band energies is cheaper. `mid = (L+R)/2` and
   `side = (L-R)/2` always sum to half the L/R energy
   (`E_m + E_s = (E_L + E_R)/2`), so comparing SUMS says nothing at all; it is
   the product that collapses when the channels are correlated (`side -> 0`),
   which is exactly when mid/side is supposed to win.

   Note what this does NOT model: quantization noise in `mid` reappears
   correlated in both output channels and noise in `side` anti-correlated, so
   mid/side changes the SPATIAL distribution of noise, not just its amount.
   Judging that needs a binaural masking model this repo does not have (see the
   namespace docstring); the rule above is a bit-count argument only."
