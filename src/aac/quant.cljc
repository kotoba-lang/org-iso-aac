(ns aac.quant
  "AAC-LC forward quantization — the inverse of `aac.dequant`. That namespace
   reconstructs

     x = sign(q) * |q|^(4/3) * 2^((scale_factor - 100) / 4)

   so the forward direction is, with `v = |x| * 2^(-(scale_factor-100)/4)`,
   picking the integer `q` whose reconstruction `q^(4/3)` is closest to `v`.

   ## Rounding: derived, not a magic number

   Encoders conventionally compute `q = (int)(pow(v, 0.75) + 0.4054)`. That
   constant is not arbitrary and it is not exact: in the compressed domain
   `u = v^(3/4)`, the boundary between reconstructing to 0 and to 1 sits at
   `((0^(4/3) + 1^(4/3)) / 2)^(3/4) = (1/2)^(3/4) = 0.5946`, i.e. at
   `1 - 0.4054` below the next integer — so 0.4054 is the EXACT
   nearest-reconstruction-level boundary for q=0 only, reused as a constant
   for every q. The exact boundary drifts upward with q (0.4054 at q=0,
   0.470 at q=1, 0.484 at q=2, ~0.486 at q=10, -> 0.5 asymptotically), so the
   constant biases larger coefficients DOWNWARD — which costs distortion and
   saves bits.

   This namespace therefore implements both and lets the caller choose:

   - `:nearest` (default) — evaluate the true boundary
     `(q^(4/3) + (q+1)^(4/3)) / 2` for the one candidate pair that matters.
     No constant, minimal squared error at a given scalefactor.
   - a number — the biased `floor(v^(3/4) + offset)` form
     (`biased-round-offset` is the conventional 0.4054).

   Because `aac.encode` closes a rate-control loop around the scalefactor, the
   bits the biased form saves are not free quality: the loop simply spends them
   on a finer scalefactor. Which one wins at EQUAL BITRATE is an empirical
   question, and it is measured rather than assumed —
   `test/aac/encode_test.clj`'s `rounding-mode-comparison` encodes the same
   input both ways at the same bit budget and compares reconstruction SNR.

   ## Per-band scalefactors and noise shaping

   `band-scalefactors` derives one absolute scalefactor per scalefactor band
   from a single frame-wide `base-sf` (what `aac.encode`'s rate loop bisects)
   plus an explicit noise-shaping exponent `alpha`, defined so that
   quantization noise power in a band is proportional to `band_rms^(2*alpha)`.

   The exponent-to-scalefactor mapping is derived from the power law itself:
   reconstruction spacing near a coefficient of magnitude `x` is
   `dx/dq = (4/3) q^(1/3) 2^s` with `s = (sf-100)/4`, and `q^(1/3) =
   (x 2^-s)^(1/4)`, so noise power per line goes as `x^(1/2) 2^(3s/2)`.
   Setting that proportional to `X^(2*alpha)` for band rms `X` gives

     sf_b = base_sf + (16*alpha/3 - 4/3) * log2(X_b / X_ref)

   Two consequences worth stating plainly, because they are easy to get
   backwards:

   1. **alpha = 1/4 means a CONSTANT scalefactor across bands** (the bracket
      is zero). The power law already shapes noise mildly toward louder bands
      on its own; a flat scalefactor is not a flat noise floor.
   2. **alpha = 0 (a genuinely flat noise floor, MSE-optimal) requires
      LOWERING the scalefactor on loud bands**, not raising it.

   The default is `alpha = 1/4` — not because it is perceptually best, but
   because it is the only value this repo can defend: choosing between the
   others needs a psychoacoustic masking model, and this repo has none (see
   `aac.encode`'s namespace docstring). It is exposed so that a caller who
   HAS a metric can measure instead of guess."
