  "AAC ADTS (Audio Data Transport Stream) frame framing — ISO/IEC 13818-7
   (MPEG-2 AAC) / ISO/IEC 14496-3 (MPEG-4 AAC) Annex. ADTS wraps raw AAC
   access units in a 7-byte (9-byte with CRC) self-contained header carrying
   sample rate, channel config, and frame length, so a stream of AAC frames
   can be split without a container. Pure cljc, zero dependencies. This
   namespace covers framing and header fields only — decoding the
   raw_data_block payload (`:payload` on each frame map) into actual PCM
   samples is `aac.decode` (mono, ONLY_LONG_SEQUENCE AAC-LC only; see that
   namespace's docstring for the full scope statement — this repo's
   original 'payload stays opaque' framing-only boundary, matching
   org-iso-h264/org-ietf-opus siblings, no longer holds ecosystem-wide now
   that this repo implements real sample decode, but `aac.adts` itself
   still only deals with the container-level header).

   The write direction (`write-header`, plus the MPEG-4 `AudioSpecificConfig`
   an MP4 container needs instead of ADTS headers) is at the bottom of this
   file; `aac.encode` is what calls it.

   New implementation (not an extraction — utsushi.bitstream/parse-adts was
   an unimplemented TODO stub) as part of the kotoba-lang reverse-domain
   media/graphics standards-substrate split (com-junkawasaki/root)."
