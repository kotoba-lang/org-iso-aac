  "AAC-LC long-window (1024-line) FORWARD MDCT + analysis windowing — the
   exact TDAC inverse of `aac.imdct/decode-frame` (ISO/IEC 14496-3:2005
   §4.6.11 filterbank, read in the encode direction). Scope, like the
   decoder's: `ONLY_LONG_SEQUENCE` only (no block switching — see the
   `aac.encode` namespace docstring for what that costs on transients).

   ## Why the forward transform carries a factor of 2

   The spec writes the decoder's IMDCT (§4.6.11.3.1) with an explicit `2/N`
   and leaves the encoder informative, so the forward scale has to be
   DERIVED from the requirement that the round trip reconstruct. Writing
   `c(n,k) = cos((2*pi/N)*(n+n0)*(k+1/2))` with N=2048, n0=(N/2+1)/2, and
   taking the forward transform as `X[k] = s * sum_n z[n] c(n,k)`, the
   decoder's `y[n] = (2/N) sum_k X[k] c(n,k)` gives

     sum_{k=0}^{N/2-1} c(m,k) c(n,k) = (N/4) * ( delta[m,n] + (-1)^j [p = jN] )

   where `p = m + n + N/2 + 1` (the difference term collapses because
   `sin(pi*(m-n)) = 0` for integer m-n; the sum term survives only where the
   denominator vanishes too, i.e. `p` a multiple of N). Substituting:

     y[n] = (s/2) * ( z[n] - z[N/2-1-n]   )   for n <  N/2   (j=1)
     y[n] = (s/2) * ( z[n] + z[3N/2-1-n]  )   for n >= N/2   (j=2)

   i.e. the classic `signal minus its time-domain alias`. The 50%-overlap-add
   of two consecutively windowed blocks cancels those alias terms and sums
   `w[i]^2 + w[N/2+i]^2 = 1` (the Princen-Bradley condition, which both the
   sine and the KBD window satisfy) — but only if the leading factor is 1,
   so `s = 2`.

   That derivation is not taken on faith: `test/aac/mdct_test.clj` feeds real
   signal through `analyze-frame` -> `aac.imdct/decode-frame` and asserts
   perfect reconstruction to ~1e-9 for BOTH window shapes, and asserts it
   FAILS at s=1 (so the test would catch a silently-wrong scale rather than
   passing on a self-consistent-but-wrong pair).

   ## Analysis window halves follow the decoder's convention exactly

   `window_shape` in a frame's `ics_info()` describes that frame's window's
   SECOND half; the first half uses the PREVIOUS frame's shape
   (§4.6.11.3.2). `aac.imdct/decode-frame` applies `prev-window-shape` to
   the first 1024 samples and `window-shape` REVERSED to the second 1024;
   `analyze-frame` below applies the identical pair to the identical halves,
   which is what makes the two exact inverses rather than merely similar.

   ## Cosine table

   The kernel argument reduces to an exact integer index: with theta = pi/1024,
   `theta*(n+512.5)*(k+0.5) = pi*j/4096` where `j = 4nk + 2n + 2050k + 1025`,
   and cos(pi*j/4096) has period 8192 in j — so an 8192-entry table indexed by
   `j mod 8192` (advanced by the recurrence `j(n+1,k) = j(n,k) + 4k + 2`)
   evaluates the whole O(N^2) transform with no trigonometry in the inner
   loop and no floating-point argument accumulation. `aac.imdct`'s decode-side
   IMDCT is deliberately NOT changed to match: its output is validated
   bit-exactly (<=2 LSB) against real ffmpeg PCM, and the two forms differ in
   the last bits, so touching it would put that golden-vector tolerance at
   risk for no decode-side benefit."
