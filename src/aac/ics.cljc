  "AAC-LC `individual_channel_stream()` side-info + spectral data decode
   (ISO/IEC 14496-3:2005 §4.4.2.7 Tables 4.44/4.6/4.46/4.47/4.50, §4.6.3
   noiseless coding), plus `channel_pair_element()` (Table 4.4, §4.4.1.1)
   for stereo. Scope (see `aac.decode`'s namespace docstring for the full
   statement): **mono OR stereo (CPE, incl. mid/side but NOT intensity
   stereo), all four `window_sequence` values** — the optional tools this
   repo doesn't implement (`predictor_data_present`, `pulse_data_present`,
   `tns_data_present`, `gain_control_data_present`, and per-scalefactor-band
   PNS/intensity-stereo pseudo-codebooks NOISE_HCB/INTENSITY_HCB/
   INTENSITY_HCB2) are read (so the bitstream position stays correct up to
   the point they're detected) and then throw immediately if set, rather
   than silently mis-decoding.

   PNS in particular is near-ubiquitous in real `ffmpeg -c:a aac`-encoded
   streams (perceptual noise substitution replaces sparse high-frequency
   content with synthesized noise, and is on by default) — real fixtures
   for this repo's tests were generated with `-aac_pns 0` for exactly this
   reason (see `test/aac/decode_test.clj`'s docstring). PNS is also
   fundamentally not bit-exact-comparable across independent decoders even
   when implemented: the spec does not mandate a specific noise generator,
   so any two spec-compliant decoders synthesize DIFFERENT sample values
   for a PNS-coded band (only the target energy is normative) — throwing
   here rather than fabricating a decoder-specific noise generator keeps
   this repo's 'decode this and compare against real ffmpeg PCM' validation
   methodology honest.

   ## Block switching / window grouping (§4.5.2.3.2, §4.6.11.3.1)

   `EIGHT_SHORT_SEQUENCE` replaces the frame's single 1024-line transform
   with eight 128-line ones. It does NOT change how many spectral
   coefficients a frame carries (still 1024) — it changes their MEANING and
   their ORDER, and it makes every piece of side info below two-dimensional
   (window group x scalefactor band) where a long frame's is
   one-dimensional:

   - `ics_info()` reads a 4-bit `max_sfb` and a 7-bit
     `scale_factor_grouping` instead of a 6-bit `max_sfb` and
     `predictor_data_present` (Table 4.6). `scale_factor_grouping` says
     which of the eight short windows share a set of scalefactors:
     `window-group-lengths` below turns it into group lengths summing to 8.
   - `section_data()` runs its section loop once PER GROUP, and its
     `sect_len_incr` field is 3 bits with escape value 7 rather than 5 bits
     with escape value 31 (Table 4.46).
   - `scale_factor_data()` runs over (group, band) pairs, with ONE DPCM
     chain continuing across the whole frame (Table 4.47).
   - `ms_mask` (in `channel_pair_element()`) likewise carries one bit per
     (group, band) pair, not per band.
   - the 1024 coefficients are stored GROUPED: within a group, a band's
     coefficients for every window in that group are contiguous
     (§4.5.2.3.4's `sect_sfb_offset`). `deinterleave-short-spectrum` below
     puts them back into transform order for `aac.imdct`.

   This namespace expresses all of that with one flat vector of
   `[start end)` coefficient ranges — `band-ranges` — indexed
   `(g * max_sfb + sfb)`, which for a long window degenerates to exactly the
   `swb_offset` pairs the long-only version of this code used. `sfb-cb`,
   `scale-factors` and `ms-mask` are all indexed the same way, so
   `aac.dequant` and `aac.stereo` need no window-sequence knowledge at all.

   ## `channel_pair_element()` (Table 4.4) — `decode-channel-pair-element!`

   Verified against FFmpeg's `libavcodec/aac/aacdec.c` `decode_cpe`/
   `ff_aac_decode_ics` (algorithm/bitstream-order only consulted, not
   copied — same reimplement-from-understanding policy as `aac.imdct`'s KBD
   window; FFmpeg is LGPL, this repo is Apache-2.0):

   - `element_instance_tag` is NOT read here — it's consumed by the caller
     (`aac.decode/decode-raw-data-block-cpe!`), same as SCE's tag handling.
   - `common_window` (1 bit). If 1: a SINGLE shared `ics_info()` (window_seq/
     window_shape/max_sfb/scale_factor_grouping) is read once for the pair,
     immediately followed by `ms_mask_present` (2 bits) + (if 1) one
     `ms_used` bit per (window group, scalefactor band) (`ms-mask!`) —
     Table 4.4's ms_mask_present==3 is reserved and throws. If
     `common_window` is 0, each channel reads its own independent
     `ics_info()` inside its own `individual_channel_stream()` (no M/S is
     possible in this case — mid/side stereo coding requires common_window,
     §4.6.8.1).
   - Both channels' `individual_channel_stream(common_window, scale_flag=0)`
     are then decoded in turn (each with its OWN global_gain/section_data/
     scale_factor_data/pulse/tns/gain-control-presence/spectral_data,
     regardless of common_window — only the ics_info() read itself is
     conditionally skipped and shared).
   - Empirically verified against `ffmpeg -c:a aac`-encoded real stereo
     content (see `test/aac/decode_test.clj`'s stereo golden-vector tests):
     `common_window=1`, `ms_mask_present=1` with a genuine MIX of 0/1
     per-band `ms_used` bits (not all-0 or all-1) — i.e. the real fixtures
     exercise both the M/S-applied and M/S-not-applied code paths in
     `aac.stereo/apply-ms` (see that namespace), under both long and
     EIGHT_SHORT window sequences."

(defn ms-mask!
  "`ms_mask_present` (2 bits) +, if 1, one `ms_used[g][sfb]` bit per (window
   group, scalefactor band) pair (Table 4.4, `channel_pair_element()`'s
   `common_window` branch). Returns a boolean vector of length
   `num-window-groups * max-sfb` (indexed the same way as `band-ranges` and
   `section-data!`'s output), or nil if `ms_mask_present`==0 (no M/S
   anywhere in this frame — the pair's channels are already coded as plain
   L/R). `ms_mask_present`==2 means 'all bands' (per-spec shorthand, no
   further bits read) — represented the same as an all-true vector so
   callers (`aac.stereo/apply-ms`) don't need a separate case. Throws on
   `ms_mask_present`==3 (reserved)."

  "`channel_pair_element()` (Table 4.4) minus `element_instance_tag` (already
   consumed by the caller — `aac.decode/decode-raw-data-block-cpe!` — same
   convention as SCE's tag handling in `decode-raw-data-block!`). Reads
   `common_window`, then (if set) the pair's single shared `ics_info()` +
   `ms_mask!`, then both channels' `individual_channel_stream()`s (each
   sharing `shared-ics-info` when `common_window`==1, per-channel
   independent otherwise — see `decode-individual-channel-stream!`'s
   docstring). Returns {:ch0 :ch1 (each `decode-individual-channel-stream!`'s
