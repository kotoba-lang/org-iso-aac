  "AAC-LC mid/side (M/S) stereo reconstruction (ISO/IEC 14496-3:2005
   §4.6.8.1 \"Mid/side (MS) stereo coding\", §4.6.8.1.3 the actual decode
   formula). Operates on the two channels' already fully DEQUANTIZED
   spectra (`aac.dequant/dequantize`'s output — real-valued, not the raw
   Huffman-decoded integer coefficients), per scalefactor band, driven by
   `aac.ics/decode-channel-pair-element!`'s `:ms-mask`.

   Cross-verified against FFmpeg's `libavcodec/aac/aacdec_dsp_template.c`
   `apply_mid_side_stereo` (algorithm only consulted, not copied — same
   policy as `aac.imdct`'s KBD window / `aac.ics`'s CPE docstring; FFmpeg is
   LGPL, this repo is Apache-2.0), which applies `libavutil/float_dsp.c`'s
   `butterflies_float(v1, v2, n)` (`t = v1[i]-v2[i]; v1[i] += v2[i]; v2[i] =
   t;`) per scalefactor band where `ms_mask[sfb]` is set — i.e. with
   `v1`=channel-0-as-coded (\"mid\") and `v2`=channel-1-as-coded (\"side\"):

     L = mid + side
     R = mid - side

   applied independently at each frequency line in that band; bands where
   `ms_mask[sfb]` is 0 (or `ms-mask` is nil entirely — `common_window`==0,
   where M/S is impossible per §4.6.8.1) are left untouched, i.e. this
   repo's `aac.ics/decode-channel-pair-element!` already decoded that band's
   two channels as plain, independent L/R (no cross-channel meaning).

   FFmpeg's own condition additionally gates on `band_type < NOISE_BT` for
   both channels (skip M/S for PNS-coded bands even if `ms_mask` is set,
   since `ms_mask` doing double duty as an NOISE/intensity-stereo signal
   flag is explicitly called out in FFmpeg's encoder comment, see
   `aacenc.c`'s `apply_mid_side_stereo`) — this repo doesn't need that
   check: `aac.ics/scale-factor-data!` already throws (out of scope) the
   moment EITHER channel uses NOISE_HCB/INTENSITY_HCB/INTENSITY_HCB2 for
   ANY band, so by the time `apply-ms` runs, no band in this frame is
   PNS/intensity-coded and the plain `ms_mask[sfb]` check is sufficient.

   Empirically verified end-to-end (not just against FFmpeg's decoder
   source): decoding a real `ffmpeg -c:a aac`-encoded stereo fixture with
   this reconstruction and comparing both resulting channels against
   `ffmpeg`'s own PCM decode of the same file matches to the same ~1 LSB
   tolerance as this repo's existing mono validation — see
   `test/aac/decode_test.clj`'s stereo golden-vector test."

(defn apply-ms
  "Reconstruct [left right] (each a full-length dequantized spectrum vector)
   from `spec0`/`spec1` (`aac.dequant/dequantize`'s per-channel output — the
   pair's two channels AS CODED: mid/side wherever `ms_used`==1, plain L/R
   otherwise) and `ms-mask` (`aac.ics/ms-mask!`'s boolean-vector-or-nil
   result) + `band-ranges` (`aac.ics/band-ranges`, giving each entry its
   [start,end) coefficient-index range). Both are indexed identically: one
   entry per scalefactor band for a long window_sequence, one per (window
   group, band) pair for EIGHT_SHORT_SEQUENCE — M/S is decided per group
   per band there, exactly as it is per band for a long window, so this
   function needs no window-sequence knowledge (nor does it care that both
   channels are still in the bitstream's grouped order at this
   point: the pair shares one `ics_info()`, hence one grouping, so the two
   are laid out identically and the reconstruction is line-for-line either
   way). `ms-mask` nil (no M/S in this frame — including whenever
   `common_window`==0, since M/S requires a shared window) short-circuits to
   `[spec0 spec1]` unchanged (already plain L/R). See namespace docstring
   for the per-band formula and its FFmpeg cross-check."
