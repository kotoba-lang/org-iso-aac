  "Regenerates the ENCODE-side test fixtures under `resources/aac/fixtures/`:

     clojure -M:fixtures

   Not part of `src` and not on the library's classpath — it exists so the
   fixtures are reproducible rather than mystery bytes, which matters more here
   than for the decode-side fixtures: those came from ffmpeg and can be
   regenerated from the one-line commands in their docstrings, whereas these
   come from THIS repo's encoder, so the recipe has to live somewhere.

   Per source signal it writes three files:

     <name>.src.pcm      the encoder's input, signed 16-bit little-endian
     <name>.aac          this repo's encoder output (ADTS)
     <name>.ffmpeg.pcm   real ffmpeg's decode of that ADTS

   The source is written out rather than only generated in code so the test's
   input is exact: `Math/sin` is not required to be bit-identical across
   platforms, so a signal regenerated on another machine would not necessarily
   be the same signal.

   The third file is the load-bearing one. It is the evidence that a real,
   independent AAC decoder reads this encoder's bitstream and recovers the
   audio — the same golden-vector methodology `aac.decode-test` uses, run in the
   other direction. Requires `ffmpeg` on PATH; without it the first two files
   are still written and the command to finish the job is printed."
