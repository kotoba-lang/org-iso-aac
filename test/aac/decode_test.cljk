(ns aac.decode-test
  "Golden-vector tests for `aac.decode` (this ecosystem's first real audio
   codec sample-decode implementation — previously only ADTS framing
   existed, see `aac.adts`'s namespace docstring).

   ## Methodology

   Every fixture here is a REAL `ffmpeg` (native `aac` encoder)-encoded ADTS
   stream, and the reference PCM every test compares against is **ffmpeg
   decoding its OWN encode** — the same golden-vector methodology this org's
   sibling repos use (e.g. `org-iso-h264`'s `decode_test.clj`, and
   `kotoba-lang/utsushi`'s `mp4_h264_test.clj`: encode with the real tool,
   decode with the real tool, diff against that). Reference PCM is committed
   alongside each fixture so CI needs no ffmpeg; the exact commands are in
   each fixture's comment below.

   All fixtures are encoded with `-aac_pns 0` and `-aac_tns 0` (stereo ones
   additionally with `-aac_is 0`) — Perceptual Noise Substitution, Temporal
   Noise Shaping and Intensity Stereo are all on by default in ffmpeg's
   encoder and all three are out of this repo's scope (`aac.ics` throws on
   each rather than mis-decoding). PNS additionally could not be
   golden-vector-tested even if it were implemented: the spec mandates only
   a PNS band's target ENERGY, not a noise generator, so two conformant
   decoders legitimately produce different samples there.

   ## Tolerance: 2 LSB of a 16-bit sample, and why

   AAC decoding is not bit-exact across implementations. The IMDCT,
   windowing and the `x^(4/3)` inverse quantizer are floating point, and
   this repo computes them in double precision while ffmpeg's native
   encoder and decoder use 32-bit `float` internally, so the two can differ
   in the last bit of a 16-bit sample. **Max diff actually observed across
   every frame of every fixture in this file is 1 LSB**, most samples being
   bit-exact; the asserted bound is 2 so that a platform whose `Math/cos` or
   `Math/pow` rounds one ulp differently does not make the suite flaky.

   Two LSB out of a signal whose peak is ~10000-30000 is about -80 dB, so
   this is not a tolerance that could absorb a decode bug: getting a window
   sequence, a scalefactor band boundary, a window grouping or an
   overlap-add offset wrong is a whole-frame, thousands-of-LSB error, not a
   rounding one. That was checked rather than assumed — see `## The tests
   discriminate` below.

   ## Block switching

   Real encoders switch from `ONLY_LONG_SEQUENCE` to `EIGHT_SHORT_SEQUENCE`
   at every transient (bridged by `LONG_START_SEQUENCE` and
   `LONG_STOP_SEQUENCE` on either side), so any stream that is not a steady
   tone contains all four sequences. `blockswitch-mono-nopns.aac` and
   `blockswitch-stereo-nopns.aac` below are built around a deliberate click
   in the middle of a tone precisely to force that, and their tests
   ASSERT that the fixture really does contain all four sequences and a
   non-trivial window grouping before comparing any PCM — a block-switching
   test whose fixture had drifted to long blocks only would otherwise pass
   while exercising nothing.

   Every fixture in this file is decoded from frame 0 to the end of the
   file. There is no cold-start caveat and no hand-picked steady-state frame
   range: this repo now decodes the same frames a real decoder does, from
   the same zero overlap history (§4.6.11.3.1's implicit zero history at
   stream start), which is why frame 0 is compared like any other.

   ## The tests discriminate

   The tolerance and the fixture-content assertions were both checked by
   breaking the implementation on purpose and confirming the tests go red:

   - dropping `LONG_START_SEQUENCE`'s transition shaping (windowing its
     right half as a full long falling window, i.e. decoding it as though it
     were ONLY_LONG): **12 failures across 4 tests, worst diff 6087 LSB**.
   - skipping the EIGHT_SHORT de-interleave (`aac.ics/
     deinterleave-short-spectrum`), so the eight short blocks are
     transformed straight from the bitstream's grouped coefficient order:
     **24 failures across 4 tests, worst diff 35468 LSB**.

   Both breaks leave `silence-golden-vector` and the side-info unit tests
   below passing, which is the right selectivity — a silent stream has no
   transient to block-switch on. Note that both also fail the two OLDER
   fixtures, not just the new ones: a sine starting abruptly from silence is
   itself a transient, so `tone1000-nopns.aac` and
   `stereo-440-880-nopns.aac` block-switch at their own stream onset."
