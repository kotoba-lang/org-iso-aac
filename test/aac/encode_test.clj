  "Tests for `aac.encode` — this repo's AAC-LC ENCODER.

   ## The golden-vector methodology, run backwards

   `aac.decode-test` validates decoding by feeding this repo a real
   ffmpeg-encoded stream and comparing against ffmpeg's own PCM. There is no
   equivalent way to validate an encoder against a reference encoder: two
   conformant AAC encoders produce completely different bitstreams (different
   quantizers, different codebooks, different bit allocation) and neither is
   wrong. What IS checkable, and is the only claim worth making, is that a real
   independent decoder reads THIS encoder's output and recovers the audio.

   So the direction flips: this repo encodes, and real ffmpeg decodes. The
   committed fixtures (regenerate with `clojure -M:fixtures`, see
   `aac.dev.fixtures`) are

     encode-tone-{mono,stereo}.src.pcm      the encoder's exact input (s16le)
     encode-tone-{mono,stereo}.aac          this encoder's output
     encode-tone-{mono,stereo}.ffmpeg.pcm   `ffmpeg -i <that> -f s16le` output

   and `ffmpeg-decodes-our-*-stream` asserts that ffmpeg's decode of that
   bitstream agrees with this repo's own decode of it to within 2 LSB — the same
   tolerance, for the same floating-point reason, as the decode-side tests. That
   is the conformance evidence, and it stays valid in CI without ffmpeg
   installed because ffmpeg's answer is committed.

   ## Why byte-exactness against the fixture is deliberately NOT asserted

   `fresh-encode-matches-the-validated-stream` re-encodes the committed source
   and compares frame count, size and reconstruction quality — not bytes.
   `Math/pow` and `Math/cos` are permitted 1 ulp of error and are not required
   to be identical across platforms or JDK versions (only `StrictMath` is), and
   a last-bit difference can flip a coefficient that sits exactly on a quantizer
   decision boundary. A byte comparison would therefore be a portability trap
   that fails on a different architecture while nothing is wrong, so it is not
   made; the durable correctness evidence is the ffmpeg comparison above, which
   tolerates exactly that kind of difference.

   ## What the numeric floors mean

   The SNR floors below are set from measured values with margin, and they are
   floors on SQUARED ERROR, not on perceived quality. This encoder has no
   psychoacoustic model, so its SNR at a given bitrate is expected to be HIGHER
   than a perceptual encoder's while sounding no better — see `aac.encode`'s
   namespace docstring. A regression that made the audio worse would show up
   here; an SNR number here is not evidence of quality parity with ffmpeg."
