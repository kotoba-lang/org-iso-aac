  "Tests for `aac.mdct` — the FORWARD filterbank. These are not
   golden-vector tests against another implementation (there is no reference
   forward-MDCT bitstream to compare against: an encoder's transform output
   is internal, only the resulting BITSTREAM is observable, and that is what
   `aac.encode-test` checks against real ffmpeg). What is checkable here, and
   what actually pins the derivation in `aac.mdct`'s namespace docstring, is
   that forward-then-inverse RECONSTRUCTS: `analyze-frame` ->
   `aac.imdct/decode-frame` -> overlap-add must return the input signal.

   The scale factor is the part that a self-consistent-but-wrong pair would
   silently get away with, so `perfect-reconstruction-pins-the-scale` also
   asserts that the reconstruction FAILS when the forward scale is perturbed
   — otherwise a test that only checks 'round trip works' would pass for a
   transform pair that is off by a constant everywhere."

;; --- the IMDCT's symmetry fold ----------------------------------------
;;
;; `aac.imdct/imdct` does not evaluate §4.6.11.3.1's formula the way the
;; spec writes it: it folds the N outputs onto N/2 distinct cosine rows and
;; indexes a shared 4N-entry cosine table (see that namespace's comment for
;; the two identities the fold rests on). That is exact algebra, but it is
;; algebra written by hand, so it is pinned against the literal transcription
;; — `imdct-reference`, which is kept in the source for exactly this purpose.
;;
;; The two agree far below the round-off of the double arithmetic they are
;; both made of, so the bound here is tight enough that a fold with a
;; wrong sign, a wrong row or an off-by-one index could not slip under it:
;; any of those changes an output by a value of the same order as the output
;; itself. (This runs the reference form, which is 2 million cosine
;; evaluations at N=2048 — hence one spectrum per length rather than a sweep.)
